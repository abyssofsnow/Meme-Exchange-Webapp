# Meme-Exchange
1. This app, Meme Exchange, is an online marketplace where users upload and exchange memes. 
2. Our Minimum Viable Product goals are: 
- Users should be able to register for accounts and login to their previously-created accounts. 
  - User accounts should consist of a profile photo, a short bio, and then a meme collection. 
- Users should be able to upload a meme consisting of a photo, title, and a list of associated tags. 
- Memes can be tagged with up to ten tags that are user-generated. 
- Users can trade memes one-to-one, and ownership of the memes are swapped. 
  -The swapped memes will display on the appropriate owners' profiles. The homepage will display memes to the user. 
3. For M1, users should be able to register for accounts and login, as well as personalizing their accounts. The homepage will display the last uploaded meme; memes will be planted in the data store. 
4. For M2, users should be able to upload and trade memes. 
5. As far as our stretch goals go: 
- users can rate memes (up/downvote), which give them currency. 
  -This currency can be exchanged for other users' memes. 
- New users will have a classic default meme uploaded to their accounts. 
- On the homepage, scoreboards will be present. These are for most memes and most upvoted memes. 
- Users can follow others and be followed in return.
